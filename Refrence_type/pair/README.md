<h3>Pair (Tuple)</h3>
<p>A pair is a tuple that contains exactly two elements, which can be of different data types.</p>
<p>It doesn't represent array but have index</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pairs are ordered, meaning the elements have a defined order and can be accessed by their index.</li>
    <li>Pairs are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.</li>
    <li>Pairs can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, or other tuples.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating a Pair</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use parentheses ( ) to define a pair, e.g., (1, 6).</li>
    <li>For a single element, include a trailing comma, e.g., (1,).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Elements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Access elements using indexing, e.g., my_pair[0] returns the first element.</li>
    <li>Negative indexing can be used to access elements from the end, e.g., my_pair[-1] returns the second element.</li>
</ul>
